# üß† ArXiv Research Supervisor Agent  
*A LangGraph-based RAG System for Automated Scientific Literature Synthesis*

---

## üìò Overview
This project implements an **AI-driven research workflow** that autonomously retrieves, analyzes, and synthesizes information from academic literature and the public web.  
It leverages **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI models** to perform multi-step reasoning across multiple data sources (ArXiv, Pinecone RAG, and web search) to produce structured academic summaries.

This system serves as a proof-of-concept for **autonomous research orchestration**, where an intelligent ‚ÄúSupervisor Agent‚Äù dynamically decides which retrieval or reasoning tool to invoke next ‚Äî all within a self-contained, explainable graph.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Supervisor Agent** | Orchestrates the workflow by choosing the next best tool based on context and prior results. |
| **RAG Tools** | Perform semantic retrieval using a Pinecone vector index, returning highly relevant academic text chunks. |
| **Fetchers** | Collect academic papers or abstracts directly from the ArXiv API. |
| **Web Search** | Uses SerpAPI or similar connectors to fetch the most recent and relevant scientific articles or press releases. |
| **Finalization** | Synthesizes retrieved results into a structured research report (introduction, main body, conclusion, sources). |

**Figure 1.** *Graph-based architecture of the ArXiv Research Supervisor Agent.*  
The **Supervisor** node governs all tool calls dynamically. It evaluates retrieved evidence, decides which tool to use next (`rag_search`, `fetch_arxiv`, `web_search`), and terminates with a structured `final_answer` once sufficient information has been gathered.

---

## üß© Key Features

- **Dynamic Tool Selection:**  
  The Supervisor decides the best next action at each reasoning step (no hard-coded logic).

- **RAG Integration:**  
  Uses Pinecone vector embeddings for semantic retrieval of scientific abstracts and metadata.

- **Multi-Source Fusion:**  
  Synthesizes findings from ArXiv, academic databases, and live web sources.

- **Structured Final Reports:**  
  Outputs complete research summaries with fields:  
  `introduction`, `research_steps`, `main_body`, `conclusion`, and `sources`.

üì¶ Installation
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/arxiv-research-agent.git
cd arxiv-research-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
If running in Google Colab:

python
Copy code
!pip install langgraph langchain openai pinecone-client serpapi python-dotenv
üöÄ Usage
Run the full reasoning loop
python
Copy code
result = run_pipeline(
    user_input="Summarize recent breakthroughs in single-cell RNA sequencing from q-bio.GN papers.",
    chat_history=[],
    max_steps=6
)

print(result)
Generate the human-readable report
python
Copy code
report = build_report(result["intermediate_steps"][-1].tool_input)
print(report)
üß© Example Research Workflow
Supervisor chooses rag_search to retrieve academic papers.

Evaluates the results and calls web_search to enrich with newer publications.

Once sufficient context exists, calls final_answer.

A complete report is assembled with citations, structured text, and linked sources.
